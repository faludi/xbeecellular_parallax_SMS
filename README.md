# xbeecellular_parallax_SMS
With Digi XBee Cellular, a Parallax ActivityBot can be controlled with text messages from any cell phone, from anywhere in the world. This BlocklyProp code gives full SMS control of the robot from a smartphone. It can also operate autonomously, using its whiskers to avoid collisions.
