# xbeecellular_parallax_SMS
With Digi XBee Cellular, a Parallax ActivityBot can be controlled with text messages from any cell phone, from anywhere in the world. This BlocklyProp code gives full SMS control of the robot from a smartphone, or it can operate autonomously by using its whiskers to avoid collisions.

* The .svg file contains the BlocklyProp code that runs the robot.
* The .c and .side files are the same code, exported for SimpleIDE
